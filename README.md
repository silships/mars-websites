Skills are expertise packs that make AI assistants better at specific tasks. They work with Cursor, Claude Code, Cline, Windsurf, and other AI editors.

### Step 1: Create a new folder and open it in Cursor

### Step 2: Install the skill

Ask your AI assistant:

> "Install the premium-frontend-design skill from kv0906/cc-skills"

Or run: `npx skills add kv0906/cc-skills/premium-frontend-design`

### Step 3: Ask for what you want

> "Create a premium website about space exploration"

> "Build a cinematic landing page for a coffee brand"

> "Make a terminal-style portfolio website"

The AI now has access to premium design patterns and will build it for you.
